# Transcriptomics-pipeline
This is RNA-seq analysis pipeline that is used to study host/pathogen transcriptomic changes in COVID-associated mucormycosis.
The pipeline designed to investigate transcriptomic alterations associated with COVID-associated mucormycosis. This pipeline supports end to end analysis such as quality control, read alignment or quantification, differential gene expression analysis, and downstrean functional interpretation. All scripts are well-documented and designed to facilitate transparent and reproducible research. 
Raw sequencing data is not hosted in this repository, but it is uploaded to National Center for Biotechnology Information  - Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) with accession number  GSE226677 under Bio Project PRJNA941219. This repository contains all analysis scripts and visualization outputs required to reproduce the analyses. This pipeline can be executed on Linux-based systems and Rstudio and is compatible with high-performance computing environments.
